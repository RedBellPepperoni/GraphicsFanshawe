# Audio Project #2
 This project Deals with the DSP effects and 3D spatial audio

 # instructions 

Step 1 : Compile the [GraphicsCode] Project and the [GraphicsApplication] project
Step 2 : Then setup the [GraphicApplication] project as startup project
Step 3 : Build + run the project


If the Project fails to run, its probably cuz the fmod and assimp dll file are missing from the build output folder [x64/Release] or [x64/Debug]
You can find these files in the [Dlls] folder at the root of the solution directory, just in case you want to copy them manually.
